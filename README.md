# fuzzy-dates

`fuzzy-dates` is a Haskell library for parsing dates when you don't know/care to specify the format of the dates beforehand.

It is heavily based off of <https://gitlab.com/doshitan/hourglass-fuzzy-parsing>, which had not been updated for over 2 years at the time of writing, so I created this library, and added numerous new date formats to it.
